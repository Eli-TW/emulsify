# Emulsify: Pattern Lab + Drupal 8

Component-driven prototyping tool using [Pattern Lab v2](http://patternlab.io/) automated via Gulp/NPM. Also serves as _a starterkit_ Drupal 8 theme.

## Requirements

  1. [Node (we recommend NVM)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  2. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
  3. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
  4. Optional: [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

## Quickstart (Emulsify Standalone)
Emulsify supports both NPM and YARN.

Install with NPM:
`composer create-project fourkitchens/emulsify --stability dev --no-interaction emulsify && cd emulsify && npm install`

Install with Yarn:
`composer create-project fourkitchens/emulsify --stability dev --no-interaction emulsify && cd emulsify && yarn install`

## Drupal-specific installation

### In a Composer-based Drupal install (recommended)

  1. `composer require fourkitchens/emulsify`
  2. Enable Emulsify and its dependencies    
      `drush then emulsify -y`    
      `drush en components unified_twig_ext -y`
  3. **Optional**: Create a cloned theme by manually duplicating it and making the neccessary renaming of files, folders and data in the info file.    
  (There is a `drush emulsify "THEME NAME"` command to automatically do this, but it works with Drush 8.x only.)
  4. If you created a cloned theme, `cd web/themes/custom/THEME_NAME/`.   
  If not, `cd web/themes/contrib/emulsify/`
  5. `npm install` or `yarn install`
  6. If you created a cloned theme, disable the original Emulsify theme (`drush pmu emulsify -y`) and enable your new theme in Drupal and set to default. (You need to compile the files to get the theme working. See the "Starting Pattern Lab…" section below.)

If you're not using a Composer-based Drupal install (e.g. tarball download from drupal.org) installation [instructions can be found on the Wiki](https://github.com/fourkitchens/emulsify/wiki/Installation).

Troubleshooting Installation: See [Drupal Installation FAQ](https://github.com/fourkitchens/emulsify/wiki/Installation#drupal-installation-faq).

## Starting Pattern Lab and watch task

The `start` command spins up a local server, compiles everything (runs all required gulp tasks), and watches for changes.

  1. `npm start` or `yarn start`
